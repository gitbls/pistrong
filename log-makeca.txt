Build a prescriptive strongSwan CA for iOS, Windows, and Linux devices

** You will be asked a series of configuration questions
   You will be prompted before any changes are made to your system

** The CA requires a domain name
   If you have a registered domain name to use for the VPN, use that
   If not, you can use a name of your choice
   NOTE: This must be a DNS name, not an IP address

Domain Name to use [noname.com]: 
** Configuring strongSwan for host FQDN p83.noname.com

** 'vpnaddr' is the DNS name or IP address that VPN clients use when connecting to the VPN Server
   Use your externally available DNS name if you have one, otherwise use your Internet IP address

vpnaddr for your VPN [p83.noname.com]: 
** 'vpndev' is the network device that will be connected to the Internet
   If your system has:
    One network device: Use that device
    > 1 network device: Use the device that is or will be connected to the Internet
                        either directly or indirectly through a router

Network device that will be connected to the Internet [eth0]: 
** 'landev' is the network device that is connected to the local LAN
   If your system has:
    One network device:  Use that device
    > 1 network device:  Use the device that is not 'eth0'

Network device that will be connected to the local LAN [eth0]: 
** VPN Server IP configuration
** 'myipaddr' Local LAN IP Address
   If your system has:
    One network device: Use the IP Address of that device
    > 1 network device: Use the IP Address of 'eth0'

VPN Server Local LAN IP Address [192.168.92.224]: 
** 'mysubnet' is the Local LAN Subnet
   If you have multiple network adapters this is the subnet of the adapter
    connected to the LAN network (eth0) rather than
    the adapter connected to the Internet (eth0)

VPN Server Local LAN Subnet [192.168.92.0/24]: 
** The Subnet for VPN Clients is a virtual subnet used between
   the VPN Server and Clients. It must not be used on your network
   and requires iptables configuration, which will be created
   by this script (although you'll need to enable it)

Subnet for VPN Clients [10.1.10.0/24]: 
** The DNS Server should be a DNS Server on your network
   This can be your router (if so configured) or another DNS Server

DNS Server for connected VPN Clients [192.168.92.1]: 
** 'cnsuffix' is a naming string only used in user certs
   (e.g., username-device-p83@cnsuffix)
   It is used by iOS for additional Cert validation
   and will be visible for strongSwan connections in the system log

cnsuffix for your CA [myvpn.net]: 
** 'webdir' is the directory in the file system where certs will be shared via your web server

webdir for your system [/var/www/html/vpn]: % Directory /var/www/html/vpn does not exist. Be sure to create it before using pistrong --mail

** 'weburl' is the URL that will be used in emails to users with their certs

weburl for your system [http://p83.noname.com/vpn]: 
** Configure the SAN Key (remoteid) and VPN Cert name for iOS, Windows, and Linux users
   The VPN Cert name prefix is important because it helps you retain your sanity
   The remoteid identifies the connection to strongSwan, and is assigned to users when they are added
   The defaults are acceptable, but you may change them if you wish

VPN Cert name prefix for iOS VPN Cert [ios]: VPN SAN key for iOS users [ios.noname.com]: VPN Cert name prefix for Windows VPN Cert [windows]: VPN SAN key for Windows users [windows.noname.com]: VPN Cert name prefix for Linux VPN Cert [linux]: VPN SAN key for Linux users [linux.noname.com]: 
** The default secondary VPN SAN Key is 'p83.noname.com'
   You can add additional SAN Keys if desired

Additional Secondary VPN SAN Key(s) []: 
** This script will now create:
      Connection Config:    /etc/swanctl/conf.d/pistrong-CAServerConnection.conf
      CA Cert:              strongSwanCACert.pem
      VPN Cert for iOS:     ios-strongSwanVPNCert.pem with VPN SAN key 'ios.noname.com'
      VPN Cert for Windows: windows-strongSwanVPNCert.pem with VPN SAN key 'windows.noname.com'
      VPN Cert for Linux:   linux-strongSwanVPNCert.pem with VPN SAN key 'linux.noname.com'

   For VPN Server LAN IP 192.168.92.224 subnet 192.168.92.0/24 with VPN Client DNS servers 192.168.92.1

   The VPN will use virtual subnet 10.1.10.0/24 for VPN Clients

   Each VPN cert will have 'p83.noname.com' as secondary VPN SAN key(s)

   The default VPN Server Address is 'p83.noname.com'
   This can be changed on a per-user basis on the 'sudo pistrong add' command for a single user
    using the --vpnaddr new-vpn-address switch
    (You might want to do this, for example, if you're using an IP address to connect externally
     but also want to test connecting to the VPN server from your internal network)
   See https://github.com/gitbls/pistrong/blob/master/README.md
    for additional VPN Server IP Address considerations

See 'sudo pistrong config --list' for a list of all the pistrong configuration parameters
 and make any changes necessary for your configuration

** If you'd like to change anything, answer N to the next question and restart the script

Your strongSwan CA is configured

Creating /etc/swanctl/pistrong/CA-iptables with firewall rules
** I have created the service pistrong-iptables-load, but it is not enabled
** If you have another way to load iptables, you must add the code from /etc/swanctl/pistrong/CA-iptables to it
** Otherwise you must 'sudo systemctl enable --now pistrong-iptables-load'

Creating /etc/swanctl/conf.d/pistrong-CAServerConnection.conf with the new VPN Server definitions

 ** Next steps:
    * Ensure that the firewall rules in /etc/swanctl/pistrong/CA-iptables are correct
    * Review https://github.com/gitbls/pistrong/blob/master/README.md#firewall-considerations
    * Establish port forwarding on your router to IP 192.168.92.224 for UDP ports 500 and 4500
    * Set up a mail server and web server if you want to email cert information to users
